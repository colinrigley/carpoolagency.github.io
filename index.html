            We are in love with information. We study the way it flows. We look for where it's born, and where it dies. We find where it lives and where it hides. We watch to see who it impacts and why it sometimes misses its intended target. We analyze who it touches and how it moves. Information is the electricity that gives life to modern companies. At Carpool, we want everyone to get the most out of that life.

                            We start by taking a deep dive to learn about your business so we can help you do what you do, only better. This means learning about the people who make up your business: Who are the thought leaders; the go-getters; and the shy, wallflower types? Communication is about people, not technology. That's why we get to know you better so we can build the strategies and toolsets that help you get the most out of your people.
